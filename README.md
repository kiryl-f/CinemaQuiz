# CinemaQuiz

Here's this app's link in Google Play:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirvelstudios.cinemaquiz&hl=ru&gl=US

That's a simple Android quiz-game with 4 game modes: guess film / TV-series by shot, guess director by his filmography and guess film by quote from it. 

P.S: Google Play is a little different(it uses HTTP-client other than Retrofit and doesn't have "Guess TV-Series game mode). I decided to rewrite back-end part of this app with Retrofit, but, as I'm no longer an owner of this app, Google Play version is a little different.
